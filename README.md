# CurrencyConverter

Currency converter using Exchange-Rate API for current exchange rates. Project will be created using HTML, CSS and JS.

## Learning objectives:
- DOM manipulation
- Creating clear functions
- Creating a responsive design
- Web application that can be useful

## Get API

I used https://www.exchangerate-api.com/ to create an account and get a unique API Key to use in the code. Standard response format was selected - given a supplied base currency it will return the whole list of other currencies we support and their corresponding exchange rates.
